                        <h3>Bachelor Of Early Childhood Education (BECEd)</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The circular shape of the logo represents continuity of learning.

                        <p>The college is committed in producing employable graduates who are highly competent and dedicated in achieving excellence in all their endeavors. That is why, the Latin word for “Competence and Excellence” is embedded in the college official logo.</p>
                        <br>
